				<div class="bio-container">
					<p>A mature R&ampB vocalist who excelled most with slower, sensual material ("Slowly, Surely," "I'm Not Afraid," "My Love") and was versatile enough to pack plenty of punch with anthems of pride and self-empowerment ("Golden," "Family Reunion," "Hate on Me"), Jill Scott grew up in north Philadelphia and began her performing career reading her own poetry. </p>

					<p>She was heard by Ahmir "?uestlove" Thompson, drummer in the Roots, who invited her to join the band in the studio, resulting in the co-composition <span><a class = "music" href="http://youtu.be/FDpLJ_y2YPs">"You Got Me,"</a></span>a 1999 Top 40 pop hit that actually featured Erykah Badu instead of Scott herself. Subsequently, she collaborated with Eric Benet, Will Smith, and Common, and broadened her performing experience by touring Canada in a production of the Broadway musical Rent.</p>

					<p>Signed to Steve McKeever's newly formed Hidden Beach label, she released her debut album, Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds, Vol. 1, in July 2000. One of the most favorably reviewed R&ampB albums of the year, the set peaked within the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 chart and reached number two on the Top R&ampB/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Experience: Jill Scott 826+, featuring a lengthy live set on one disc and studio material (including a soaring collaboration with 4hero) on a second disc, appeared the following summer. Scott's star power soared over the next year, eventually earning her a Grammy nomination in early 2003 for Best Female Vocal Performance for <span><a class="music" href ="http://youtu.be/TSYMKUtNuw8"> "A Long Walk."</a></span> Scott lost that award, but won a 2005 Grammy for Best Urban/Alternative R&ampB Performance for <span><a class="music" href="http://youtu.be/tKEjKhg95_g"> "Cross My Mind."</a><span></p>
